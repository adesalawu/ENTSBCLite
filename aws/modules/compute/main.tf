# âœ… Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): The foundation of AWS network architecture is the VPC. It's a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch resources in a virtual network that you define. VPC enables you to control IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, security groups, and network gateways.
